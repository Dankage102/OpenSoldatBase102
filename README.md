### Layout

The content of this repository is meant to be bundled into 3 archive files:

- `soldat.smod` - Contains the base game files such as image, audio and animation files. More information in `.smod` files can be found on [this post on the Soldat forums](https://forums.soldat.pl/index.php?topic=44917.0).
- `client.zip` - Contains client directory structure, configuration files and accessory files.
- `server.zip` - Contains server directory structure, configuration files and accessory files.

### Instructions

In order to avoid issues with [reliably reproducing archives](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/archives), the recommended way to get these files is to download them from the [latest release](https://github.com/Soldat/base/releases/latest).

If you wish to create your own `soldat.smod` file, run `python3 create_smod.py` from the root of this repository, and it will create the archives for you. It attempts to produce the same byte-for-byte archive files regardless of what operating system it is run on, but it is potentially fragile due to the issues mentioned previously.

### Contributions
